Classes
-------
1. Run - Entry point to the program
2. Practice - Data type (class) that represents a NHS practice
3. Parse - Class that parses the input files
4. Questions - Class that contains a list of generic questions
5. ScanData - Class that scans/searches all data to find the answer to a question

Ideas
-----
- Add a cache mechanism/functionality (For last 10 questions asked)
- Clean up code (Maybe check if any design patterns can be used)
- Add unit testing (Use a separate class and test all important methods)
- Change output type to String instead of using the Object type (To make the code cleaner)
